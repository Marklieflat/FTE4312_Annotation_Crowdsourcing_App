# FTE4312_Proofreading_Project
The repository of De-data Proofreading crowdsourcing App

## Introduction: (Glynn)  

In the rapidly evolving digital era, the surge in data generation, particularly in the realm of audio and speech, presents both an opportunity and a challenge. The "De-data Proofreading crowdsourcing App" emerges as a pivotal solution to the modern-day data deluge, addressing the critical need for accurate and efficient processing of speech data. This project is not just an innovation in data handling but also a stride forward in leveraging the potential of crowd-sourced intelligence and blockchain technology.

What truly sets our app apart is its decentralized framework. This approach is pivotal in distributing large datasets across a wide network of proofreaders, thereby enhancing efficiency and speed. Decentralization not only accelerates the proofreading process but also ensures a higher quality of output through multi-level scrutiny. It's a beacon of security and transparency, where every transaction and modification is indelibly recorded on the blockchain, assuring accountability and trust.

Moreover, this decentralized system lays the foundation for a fair and motivating economic model. Proofreaders are justly compensated, incentivizing top-quality work. The platform's inclusivity extends beyond geographical, age, or gender barriers, offering equal opportunities to a diverse pool of talent.

In essence, the De-data Proofreading App is more than a technological marvel, it's a confluence of human expertise and technological prowess. It embodies the potential of decentralization in enhancing data processing, making us not just transcribers of words, but interpreters of meaning and context.

At De-data, we take pride in creating a space where technology complements human intelligence, leading the charge in revolutionizing speech data understanding and utilization in our interconnected digital landscape.

## Motivation: (Zekai)  
### Market value:
 Speech recognition market continues to grow at a high rate, driven by recognition accuracy improvement in 2017-2022, with an average annual compound growth rate of about 26% in 2022, the market size of 13.640 billion yuan in 2022; 2022-2027 application scenarios expanding Driven by the expansion of application scenarios in 2022-2027, the average annual compound growth rate of about 28%, the market size in 2027 is expected to exceed 45 billion yuan exceeded 45 billion yuan.

 ### Trend in Technologies
 The labelling of speech data is crucial for training machine learning models. By providing high-quality data annotation, we can help organisations better leverage AI technology to gain an edge in a competitive market.

 ### Pain point
 1. High volume of data for labelling tasks
 Time-consuming and space-consuming transmission.
 2. Long delivery times
 For example, the fastest time for KDDI to artificially convert 1 hour of audio and video is 3 hours, 5-8 hours for subtitles, and 12 hours for English.
 3. Complexity and diversity of content
 Multi-language, multi-professional and regional dialect accents, low volume, many speakers, fast speech, background noise and other complex audio and video or special format requirements of audio and video processing.
 4. Duplicate proofreading
 Facing duplicate proofreading or proofreading requesters not benefiting from duplicate proofreading of data.

## Significance & Novelty: (Mark)  
### Advantages：
1. Multi-Level Crowdsourcing：
This approach first involves small-scale crowdsourcing, followed by integration and further crowdsourcing. It allows for efficient handling of large volumes of data by breaking them down into manageable parts and distributing them among various proofreaders.
2. Creation of a Proofreader Database：
The platform leverages AI to train, evaluate, grade, and tag proofreaders, ensuring a steady supply of qualified online proofreaders. This database enhances the quality and reliability of the proofreading process.
3. Blockchain Incentives：
The platform uses a decentralized blockchain-based system for two-way incentives. It records data features and processing on a public blockchain, offering discounts to requesters who obtain results directly from processed data and rewards to data providers.
4. Employment Opportunities Regardless of Location, Age, or Gender
The platform provides employment opportunities that are not limited by geographical location, age, or gender. Anyone who qualifies through online training and assessment can accept tasks and work online.

### Novelty and Reasons for Decentralization:
1. Efficiency in Handling Large Data Volumes:
Decentralization allows for the distribution of large data sets among many proofreaders, making the proofreading process more efficient and faster.
2. Quality Assurance through Multi-Level Proofreading:
The multi-level approach ensures high-quality outcomes as data passes through various levels of scrutiny.
3. Enhanced Security and Transparency:
Using blockchain for data processing ensures a secure and transparent process, as all transactions and changes are recorded on the blockchain.
4. Economic Incentives and Fair Compensation:
The blockchain-based incentive system ensures fair compensation for proofreaders and motivates high-quality work.
5. Flexibility and Accessibility:
The platform's lack of restrictions regarding location, age, or gender makes it accessible to a wide range of individuals, promoting inclusivity and offering flexible work opportunities.
